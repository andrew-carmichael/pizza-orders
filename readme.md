Just a simple demo app I built for fun. This demonstrates that an Android application can be build for both Android TV and Mobile, but present different UI depending on the platform. It has a simple GoLang backend that uses websockets to simulate incoming orders, and allow the orders to be completed on the clients. The app could be installed on a typical mobile device, or on an Android TV in a kitchen etc.
